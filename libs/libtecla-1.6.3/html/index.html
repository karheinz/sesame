<H1>The Tecla command-line editing library.</H1>

The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive
command line editing facilities, similar to those of the UNIX tcsh
shell. In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports recall
of previously entered command lines, TAB completion of file names or
other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of filenames.  The
internal functions which perform file-name completion and wild-card
expansion are also available externally for optional use by programs.
<P>
In addition, the library includes a path-searching module.  This
allows an application to provide completion and lookup of files
located in UNIX style paths. Although not built into the line editor
by default, it can easily be called from custom tab-completion
callback functions. This was originally conceived for completing the
names of executables and providing a way to look up their locations in
the user's PATH environment variable, but it can easily be asked to
look up and complete other types of files in any list of directories.

<P>
Note that special care has been taken to allow the use of this library
in threaded programs. The option to enable this is discussed in the
Makefile, and specific discussions of thread safety are presented in
the included man pages.
