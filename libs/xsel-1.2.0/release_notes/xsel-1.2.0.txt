xsel 1.2.0 Release
------------------

XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of the X
selection. Normally this is only accessible by manually highlighting
information and pasting it with the middle mouse button.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

New in this release
-------------------

This is a maintenance release, improving argument handling, documentation
and X11 library detection.

Details:

 * Added handling of combined single-letter arguments, so "xsel -ao" is
   equivalent to "xsel -a -o". Patch by Christopher Wellons.

 * Corrected man page section numbers, updated URLs in source comments,
   added ICCCM rant to source repository.

 * Removed hardcoded X11 libraries in Makefile.am, and use only those
   discovered by autoconf. Reported by Yair K.

About XSel
----------

XSel's most common use is to set or get the X selection:

	* To read a file into the X selection: xsel < file 
	* To write the X selection to a file:  xsel > file 

You can use xsel in shell scripts and desktop keybindings, so that the
contents of the X selection are available to command arguments:

	    mozilla --remote "openurl(`xsel`)"

XSel can also be used for some more complicated tasks:

	* To append to the X selection:        xsel --append < file 
	* To follow a growing file:            xsel --follow < file 

You can even tell applications to delete their selected text:

	* To delete the contents of the selection: xsel --delete 

Other options include various ways of manipulating the secondary and
clipboard selections, and of making the selection contents persist in
memory. For full details see:
