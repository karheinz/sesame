xsel 1.0.0 Release
------------------

XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of the X
selection. Normally this is only accessible by manually highlighting
information and pasting it with the middle mouse button.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

New in this release
-------------------

This release adds UTF-8 support and fixes various bugs.

Details:

	* Support for retrieving and serving UTF8_STRING atoms. When
	  retrieving a selection, xsel determines whether or not the
	  current selection owner supports UTF8_STRING and uses that if
	  possible.
          + Debian bug #231413: Doesn't work correctly in a UTF-8 environment 

	* Fixes for the following bugs:
	  + Segfault when attempting to delete the selection that xsel owns,
	    eg: echo "hello, world" | ./xsel -i && ./xsel -d
	  + Debian bug #444638: xsel clears buffer instead of outputting
                                when backgrounded. 
          + Debian bug #203925: xsel manpage double option 


About XSel
----------

XSel's most common use is to set or get the X selection:

	* To read a file into the X selection: xsel < file 
	* To write the X selection to a file:  xsel > file 

You can use xsel in shell scripts and desktop keybindings, so that the
contents of the X selection are available to command arguments:

	    mozilla --remote "openurl(`xsel`)"

XSel can also be used for some more complicated tasks:

	* To append to the X selection:        xsel --append < file 
	* To follow a growing file:            xsel --follow < file 

You can even tell applications to delete their selected text:

	* To delete the contents of the selection: xsel --delete 

Other options include various ways of manipulating the secondary and
clipboard selections, and of making the selection contents persist in
memory. For full details see:
