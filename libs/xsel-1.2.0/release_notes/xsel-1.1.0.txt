xsel 1.1.0 Release
------------------

XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of the X
selection. Normally this is only accessible by manually highlighting
information and pasting it with the middle mouse button.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

New in this release
-------------------

This release adds basic support for COMPOUND_TEXT and fixes a configuration
bug.

Details:

	* Support for retrieving COMPOUND_TEXT atoms. The COMPOUND_TEXT
	  atom in ICCCM is an earlier method of handling international
	  text; most modern applications use UTF8_STRING instead. The
	  level of support included here allows xsel to retrieve a
	  COMPOUND_TEXT selection verbatim, without performing charset
	  conversion. When maintaining the selection, xsel does not
	  currently attempt to serve COMPOUND_TEXT, but handles UTF8
	  requests where possible.

	  Thanks to Richard Zidlicky for reporting this bug and testing the
	  fix.

	* Fixed missing configuration checks for X11 libraries.
	  Reported by Samuel Saint-Pettersen.

About XSel
----------

XSel's most common use is to set or get the X selection:

	* To read a file into the X selection: xsel < file 
	* To write the X selection to a file:  xsel > file 

You can use xsel in shell scripts and desktop keybindings, so that the
contents of the X selection are available to command arguments:

	    mozilla --remote "openurl(`xsel`)"

XSel can also be used for some more complicated tasks:

	* To append to the X selection:        xsel --append < file 
	* To follow a growing file:            xsel --follow < file 

You can even tell applications to delete their selected text:

	* To delete the contents of the selection: xsel --delete 

Other options include various ways of manipulating the secondary and
clipboard selections, and of making the selection contents persist in
memory. For full details see:
