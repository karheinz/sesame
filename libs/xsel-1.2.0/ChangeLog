	* Version 1.0.0

	* Support for retrieving and serving UTF8_STRING atoms. When
	  retrieving a selection, xsel determines whether or not the
	  current selection owner supports UTF8_STRING and uses that if
	  possible.
	  + Debian bug #231413: Doesn't work correctly in a UTF-8 environment

	* Fixes for the following bugs:
	  + Segfault when attempting to delete the selection that xsel owns,
	    eg: echo "hello, world" | ./xsel -i && ./xsel -d
	  + Debian bug #444638: xsel clears buffer instead of outputting
	                        when backgrounded.
	  + Debian bug #203925: xsel manpage double option
